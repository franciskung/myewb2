Hello {{ user.first_name }},
<br/><br/>
Your regular membership with Engineers Without Borders Canada has expired, and 
unfortunately we have not received payment to renew your membership.

You will still able to access myEWB, and will continue to receive updates about 
our activities. However, you will not be able to attend our National Conference 
or vote at our Annual General Meeting until you renew your paid membership.  
Paid membership is also a great way to show support for the organisation, and 
we will miss you.
