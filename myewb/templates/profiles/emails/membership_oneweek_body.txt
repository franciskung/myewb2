Hello {{ user.first_name }},<br/><br/>

This is a reminder that your Engineers Without Borders Canada membership 
will expire in a week: you can renew at
<a href="http://my.ewb.ca{% url profile_pay_membership user.username %}">http://my.ewb.ca{% url profile_pay_membership user.username %}</a>.
<br/><br/>
We hope you will renew your membership: doing so will allow you to stay 
involved in the governance of the organization (through our annual general 
meeting), as well as attend our national conference.  And most importantly, it 
is also an expression of support for Engineers Without Borders.
<br/><br/>
Please consider renewing your membership for another year. Just visit 
<a href="http://my.ewb.ca{% url profile_pay_membership user.username %}">http://my.ewb.ca{% url profile_pay_membership user.username %}</a>
to renew your membership online.
<br/><br/>
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at any time at 
info@ewb.ca.  Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your 
continued involvement in EWB!
<br/><br/>
Regards,<br/>
Engineers Without Borders Canada<br/>
