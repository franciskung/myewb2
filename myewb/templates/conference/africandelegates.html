       <h1>African Delegates Leadership Development Program</h1>

       <p>
       In 2011 EWB wants to create a new opportunity for Africans to develop their leadership potential to drive change in their countries.
       At this year's conference we are offering 20 current and upcoming African leaders the chance to join us at the EWB National Conference
       as well as participate in a brand new program which will include training on leadership, innovation, and networking as well as the
       opportunity to participate in a study-tour tailored to their field of expertise.
       </p>

       <p>
       At the 2010 EWB National Conference in St. John's Newfoundland five delegates joined us from Zambia, Ghana and Malawi.
       They worked hard to interact with the intimidating crowd of 400 to make a connection between the passionate Canadians to their homes in Africa.

               <p>
               I was inspired by the participant to participant collaboration and the links with others outside the organization...
               It got me crazy thinking... I could see people ready to share with me. I've never seen such a thing. I really felt sky high

               </p>

               <p>
               I've been inspired by the heart and the attitude that Canadians have to think about issues more broadly.  Canadians think about
               how to change the whole world, saying, "my country [Canada] is ok, but what about those others?"

               <p>
               My vision has been sparked by this conference and the interactions I've had ... I need to go back to Malawi and do something
               to help people have their eyes opened
                - <em>Chrispin Dambula</em>
               </p>

               <p>
               I will tell the people in Malawi with whom I work about the connections that Africans can make in between themselves.
               I want other Africans to take advantage of that communication and to build new relationships to communicate amongst themselves

               </p>

               <p>
               I have learnt about the need to have the passion to work and to think big. I will tell my farmers that they shouldn't give up, they should think bigger

               <p><strong>They have messages for you:</strong></p>

               <p>
               Don't waste your time looking at problems of the past. We have to work under pressure. Don't waste time. We have short
               time frame and need to increase the impact because the need is very urgent.

               <p>
               Carry on the passion.  In 3-5 years time, an impact will be there that everyone will be able to attribute to EWB's work.
