Hello {{ user.first_name }},
<br/><br/>
Last year, you became a paid member of Engineers Without Borders Canada - we 
hope you have been enjoying your involvement, whether as a member of a 
student chapter or city network, participant in our online community, or 
supporter of our activities.
<br/><br/>
Your membership will expire in a month, however, and we hope you will
renew it for another year:

Renewing will allow you to stay  involved in the governance of the 
organization (through our annual general meeting), as well as attend our 
national conference.  And most importantly, it is also an expression of your 
support for Engineers Without Borders.
<br/><br/>
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at any time at 
info@ewb.ca.  Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your 
continued involvement in EWB!
<br/><br/>
Regards,<br/>
Engineers Without Borders Canada
